# ContinuousImageCaptureApp
An android application that automatically captures images on an interval. This code is based largely on Tensorflow's demo application.

# Modify time between images
Open CaptureActivity.java and change the value of [TIME_BETWEEN_CAPTURES_MS](https://github.com/roggirg/ContinuousImageCaptureApp/blob/08fabf9bb4f74672fe6e761a1f8eaf2909af7cf8/app/src/main/java/com/example/rogergirgis/wsapplication/CaptureActivity.java#L59) to the desired number of milliseconds between captures.
